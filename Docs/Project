Initial Project Notes

	*Basic plan is to create a long term project and use a massive tech stack to help familiarize myself with technologies
	
	*Backend will likely be largely in Java since I like that language and Spring Boot

	*I will probably utilize Typescript with the React framework for the frontend

	*In addition I want to try and use things like Terraform, the cloud (AWS or Azure), maybe even some more things which I have yet to think of

Rough Project Plan

	Phase 1:
		
		*Set up project and familiarize self with the new technologies

		*Create a very basic frontend and backend
			
			1. A player object with simple and few properties stored in a DB on the backend which can have its information displayed on the frontend

			2. Begin looking at how the cloud and Terraform can be implemented

		*Begin planning for more objects than just players

		*Plan for using websockets early on so that their implementation can be smoother

	Phase 2:

		*Attempt to involve the Cloud and Terraform in the project with a very basic setup. Potentially migrate DB from local SQL to something on the cloud and automate with Terraform

		*Setup a simple ci/cd pipeline

		*Add in other objects like enemies and add more complex properties to the player object

		*Learn more about frontend and improve upon the current frontend to potentially be able to display top-down movement of a player character

	Phase 3:

		*Plan this when further into the project
